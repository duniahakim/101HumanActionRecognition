# 101HumanActionRecognition

This is an implementation of different models to classify human action on the UCF101 dataset. The novel contribution is the use of Transformers model for this purpose. We build a model that is heavily inspired by the [ViViT](https://github.com/rishikksh20/ViViT-pytorch) model from Google Research.
